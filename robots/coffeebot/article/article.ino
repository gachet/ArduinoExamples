/*
This program makes your robot either seek light or avoid light, depending on how it is wired up.
Try this program first, and then start modifying it to give your robot the personality you desire.
Shine a flashlight, or hold your hand over a light sensor, to change the behavior.
Other examples and suggestions are on our website.An LED is connected to pin 9; whenever the sensors measure unequal brightness this LED is turned on
